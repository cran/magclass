\title{Write file in specific project format}
\usage{
write.reportProject(mif, mapping, file = NULL, max_file_size = NULL,
  format = "default", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mif}{Lists with magpie-objects or a magpie-object as created by read.report or a path to
a report.mif}

\item{mapping}{mapping of the variable names of the read in mif. the header
is used for naming. The format of the mapping should be: 1st column the standard naming in PIK mif format. X further columns that contain the indicator names in the reporting format. Can also contain several indicator columns (e.g Variable and Item).
Optional columns with reserved names are unit, weight, and factor.
Factor is a number that the results will be multplied with (e.g. to transform CO2 into C)
Weight is needed if several mif indicators shall be aggregated to one reporting indicator. You always need a weight column if you have multiple mif to one reporting mappings. If you have a weight column, you have to have values in it for all indicators. If NULL, the results are added up; if you provide an indicator name (of a mif indicator), this indicator will be used for the weighting of a weighted mean.
Unit is a name of the unit without ()
  Example:
"mif";"agmip";"Item";"unit";"weight";"factor"
"Nutrition|+|Calorie Supply (kcal/capita/day)";"CALO";"AGR";"kcal/capita/day";"NULL";1}

\item{file}{name of the project specipic report, default=NULL means that the names of the header of the reporting is used}

\item{max_file_size}{maximum file size in MB; if size of file exceeds max_file_size reporting is split into multiple files}

\item{format}{available reporting formats: "default", "IAMC" and "AgMIP". "default" and "IAMC" are very similar (wide format for year) and differ only in the use of semi-colon (default) and comma (IAMC) as seperator. "AgMIP" is in long format.}

\description{
Reads in a reporting.mif or uses a magpie object based on a read in
reporting.mif, substitutes names of variables according to the mappping,
mutliplies by an optional factor in a column named "factor" of the mapping, and saves
the output in a new *.mif
