\usage{
write.report(x, file = NULL, model = "MAgPIE", scenario = "default",
  unit = NA, ndigit = 4, append = FALSE, skipempty = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{MAgPIE object or a list of lists with MAgPIE objects as created by
read.report. In the latter case settings for model and scenario are
overwritten by the information given in the list.}

\item{file}{file name the object should be written to. If NULL the formatted
content is returned}

\item{model}{Name of the model which calculated the results}

\item{scenario}{The scenario which was used to get that results.}

\item{unit}{Unit of the data. Only relevant if unit is not already supplied
in Dimnames (format "name (unit)"). Can be either a single string or a
vector of strings with a length equal to the number of different data
elements in the MAgPIE object}

\item{ndigit}{Number of digits the output should have}

\item{append}{Logical which decides whether data should be added to an
existing file or an existing file should be overwritten}

\item{skipempty}{Determines whether empty entries (all data NA) should be
written to file or not.}
}
\description{
This function writes the content of a MAgPIE object into a file or returns
it directly using the reporting format as it is used for many model
intercomparisons.
