\usage{
clean_magpie(x, what = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{MAgPIE object which should be cleaned.}

\item{what}{term defining what type of cleaning should be performed. Current
modes are "cells" (removes cell numbers if the data seems to be regional -
this should be used carefully as it might remove cell numbers in some cases
in which they should not be removed), "sets" (making sure that all
dimensions have names) and "all" (performing all available cleaning methods)}
}
\value{
The eventually corrected MAgPIE object
}
\description{
Function cleans MAgPIE objects so that they follow some extended magpie
object rules (currently it makes sure that the dimnames have names and
removes cell numbers if it is purely regional data)
}
\examples{

 data(population_magpie)
 a <- clean_magpie(population_magpie)
