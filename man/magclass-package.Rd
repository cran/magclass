\title{Data Class and Tools for Handling Spatial-Temporal Data}
\description{
Data class for increased interoperability working with spatial-temporal 
data together with corresponding functions and methods (conversions, 
basic calculations and basic data manipulation). The class distinguishes
between spatial, temporal and other dimensions to facilitate the development
and interoperability of tools build for it. Additional features are name-based
addressing of data and internal consistency checks (e.g. checking for the 
right data order in calculations).
